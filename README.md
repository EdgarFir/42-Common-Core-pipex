# Pipex - Milestone 2 Common-Core project

This project aimed to implement and study the handling of **pipes** in the context of **processes** in **Unix/Linux** operating systems. Through practical development, it was possible to understand in more depth how the shell creates, manages and communicates between processes using pipes.

## Concepts learned:

- Understanding the difference between **parent** and **child** processes, as well as their relationships and synchronization.

- Using **pipes** as a **communication** mechanism between processes, allowing efficient data exchange.

- Practical visualization of how the shell implements commands with **pipes**, and how this functionality is built at the code level.

- Consolidation of knowledge about **file descriptors** and how they can be redirected to implement typical **shell** functionalities.

This project was essential to consolidate the theoretical understanding of **processes** and **pipes**, by allowing a practical application of these concepts.
